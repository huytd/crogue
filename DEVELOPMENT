DEVELOPMENT NOTES

The project is structured in a way that we can separate the
gameplay logic away from the rendering logic, this will make
it easier when we add more rendering target later on.

The only rendering target that is supported for now is terminal
using ncurses.

crogue
	+-- engine 			>> The gameplay logic
	+-- render			>> All the render target
	+-- src/main.c 		>> The entry point

Same as other games like Nethack, the gameplay logic (in /engine)
directory will be compiled into a shared library so we can initialize
and run it on some other platform.
