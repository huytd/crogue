Story:

You are a young man who is lost in a strange forest, empty-handed,
and your phone battery is already dead. You have to learn how to
survive and find your way back home.

Gameplay:

- Survive hunger by collecting anything that edible (fruits, bugs, corpse)
  Just don't get killed by food poisoning
- Crafting tools to fight wild animals or catching fishes
  Of course, you don't need a hunting license here
- Escape the forest and make it to the modern world where
  you have a cable to charge your phone, so you can all 911

Environment:

- Grass (,): Walkable, a block of 4 grass tiles can be used as a hide
  place when you're being chased.
- Water puddle (~): Walkable, if next to a grass tile, it can be collected
  to drink later on. If it's not, it might not safe to drink, and can
  ruin your whole pouch.
- Rock and metal (+): Not walkable, can be picked up for crafting or
  throwing at animals. But they're heavy.
